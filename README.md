Prometheus is an agentic tool which attempts to automate the process of writing source code that satisfies the constraints outlined in a test suite. This approach borrows from the practice of test-driven development where a developer writes tests which are expected to fail and also describe the desired behavior of code. The prometheus agent assumes the user has already written the necessary tests to specify functionality.

# Getting Started

`poetry install`

`poetry run python agent.py "$(pwd)/usecases/sum"`

expected diff for the sum usecase is:

```diff
--- a/source.py
+++ b/source.py
@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
 def add(a, b):
-    return a - b
+    return a + b
```

# Findings

All successful tests were run with `gpt-4-0125-preview`.

The `sum` usecase proves that this approach to solving problems is feasible. It was a very straightforward change which arguably had all of the necessary context to resolve in the source itself. The ability to generate a diffed solution which can be directly applied and shown to resolve the provided constraints is valuable as an existence proof.

Input source:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a - b
```

Output diff:

```diff
--- a/source.py
+++ b/source.py
@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
 def add(a, b):
-    return a - b
+    return a + b
```

One original hypothesis was that the models as-is would express little judgement when given specific instructions to solve a problem. This was shown to be the case in the `failsum` usecase. In this case the test suite provided could not have been solved by simply using an subtraction or addition operator. However, the test itself was a bit nonsensical. Instead of rejecting the tests themselves the model reliably produced a result which satisfied the constraint.

Input test source:

```python
import pytest  # noqa: F401
from source import add


def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == -2
```

Output diff:

```diff [51/1914]

# Roadmap

- support reading in multiple test and source files
- pass in additional conversational context for changes which require more than one iteration
- set up a test suite which actually validates expected diffs instead of just success / failure result states
- relax the assumption that the test execution commands and test themselves are assumed to be correct
- accept higher-level desired inputs and return tests which satisfies the constraints

# Vision

Code is ultimately executed and validated by machines. There is no reason humans need to write source code.

We have undergone a similar process of building up layers of abstraction in the past. For decades we've used compilers and assemblers to act at layers of abstraction well above the machine code that is ultimately executed on a given machine. It has been necessary for moving the art forward to understand these abstraction layers and evolve them. However, the day-to-day work of programming a computer does not require anything close to a complete understanding of each of these layers.

There have been many attempts to put source code behind a layer of abstraction in specific domains. WYSIWYG editors like ones used to develop landing pages do not require an understanding of the source code they ultimately produce. Generalizing this approach to abstracting away source code has not been successful.

Instead of obfuscating the generated source code I believe that it will take an incremental approach to ultimately abstracting away source code. In the same way that there was not a clear definition of the expected inputs when any previous layer of abstraction was created we do not yet know what the expected input is for this new layer of abstraction. What we do know is that the expected output for this layer is source code itself. This maps to the history of existing layers of abstraction. Namely, assembly language didn't exist and does not have a single form but we knew what the process of assembly needed to output: machine code.

As a starting point, our expected input for this new layer of abstraction will be unit tests and existing source code. We can incrementally evolve to remove all source code, and then all unit tests and ultimately arrive at a new expected input which is more concise and increases productivity in developing applications.

Major issues with this vision of the future:

- with respect to the current approach: other layers of abstraction are bounded, this one is not. for example, syntax errors are easy enough to define and the space for undefined behavior is rather small. you can write specs for source languages. it is not going to be easy to write a spec for natural language
